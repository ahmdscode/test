"workflow_description": "Every project starts with an idea, or sometimes a solid plan, and that’s what sets the tone for everything that follows. Before I write a single line of code, I open Figma to design clean, minimal layouts that look good and feel natural to use. For simple landing pages, I stick with the classics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — quick to load and easy to maintain. If the site needs to be interactive and complex, I switch to React.js, to keep everything clean but never overcomplicated. Behind the scenes, I mostly work with Node.js. It’s reliable, fast, and fits perfectly with JavaScript everywhere else. In short, I believe less is more — keeping everything minimalistic, with no clutter or extras, just clean, functional and user-friendly."
